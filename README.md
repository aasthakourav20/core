# Django REST Framework CRUD API

This repository contains a Django REST Framework (DRF) project that implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Function-Based Views (FBVs). The API is designed to perform CRUD operations on a specific data model and serves as a simple yet effective example of RESTful API development.

* Read: Retrieve data (individual or list of records).
* Update: Modify existing records.
* Delete: Remove records from the database.
* Built using Django and Django REST Framework.
* Utilizes Function-Based Views (FBVs) for simplicity and clarity.
* Follows RESTful design principles.
